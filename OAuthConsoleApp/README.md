OAuth for Apps: Sample Console Application for Windows
======================================================

This sample shows how to do an OAuth 2.0 Authorization flow from a Windows
Console application. It is one of a [series of OAuth samples](../README.md)
for Windows.

Introduction
------------

When doing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization flow in a native application, it is 
important to follow best practices, which require using the browser (and not 
an embedded browser).

This sample demonstrates how you can open the user's browser with your OAuth 2.0
authorization request (where they might already be logged in!), have them
complete the consent, receive the Authorization Code using a local loopback
socket, and exchanging that code for authorization tokens.

Google Documentation
--------------------

The protocols referenced in this sample are documented here:

- [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
- [Using OAuth 2.0 for Mobile and Desktop Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Open the solution file: `OAuthConsoleApp.sln`
2. Run the app.
3. When the app starts, tap any key and go through the flow.
4. Tap any key to exit.


Using your own credentials
--------------------------

The Sample comes backed with some demo client credentials, which are fine for
testing, but make sure you use your own credentials before releasing any app,
or sharing it with friends.

1. Visit the [Credentials page of the Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=_)
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 client, select `Other`
3. Copy the client id and client secret, and replace the values supplied in this
   sample.

Advanced Reading
----------------

The protocols and best practices used and implemented in these samples are
defined by RFCs. These expert-level documents detail how the protocols work,
and explain the reasoning behind many decisions, such as why we send a
`code_challenge` on the Authorization Request for a native app.
