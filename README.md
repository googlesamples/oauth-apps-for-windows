OAuth for Apps: Samples for Windows
============

This repository contains samples for doing OAuth 2.0 to Google for Windows apps,
including universal apps, traditional desktop apps, and CLI tools.

Introduction
------------

When doing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization flow to Google in a native application, it
is important to follow 
[best practices](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps), 
which require using the browser (and not an embedded browser).

These samples show how to complete an OAuth 2.0 Authorization request in a
traditional app, where a loopback redirect is used to received the code, and in
a universal app where a URI scheme is used for the same.

> **Note**  
> When using Google APIs, the [Google.Apis.Auth](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Google.Apis.Auth/)
> package provides an OAuth2 implementation which integrates with Google Cloud Platform.

Samples
-------

[OAuthUniversalApp](OAuthUniversalApp/README.md) - Universal Windows Platform 
(UWP) sample app

[OAuthDesktopApp](OAuthDesktopApp/README.md) - Traditional desktop  
application sample (using WPF).

[OAuthConsoleApp](OAuthConsoleApp/README.md) - Command Line Interface (CLI)
console application sample.

All samples achieve the same end result of authenticating the user in the
system browser, but with environment-specific optimizations.

Advanced Reading
----------------

The protocols and best practices used and implemented in these samples are
defined by RFCs. These expert-level documents detail how the protocols work,
and explain the reasoning behind many decisions, such as why we send a
`code_challenge` on the Authorization Request for a native app.
